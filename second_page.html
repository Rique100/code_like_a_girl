<p>This website was developed and created to help the homeless and stray animals .In <em> OUR COUNTRY </em> we know our government is not the best when it comes to helping people and the community so it is our job as <em> A COUNTRY,A UNITED NATION </em> to stand together and help our fellow brothers and sisters and stray animals in our communities .If you are reading this you are fortunate to have a roof over your head ,food on your plate and clothes on your back because there are people out there who don't have shelter ,food and basic needs to survive.it is a cruel and unfair world ,we cannot change that ,but we can at least make it a little more comfortable for the next person .We are trying to <em> CHANGE South Africa</em>.We want to make a difference.
